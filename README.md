💳 Bank ATM Simulator with Database(with SQLite)
Sqlite is prebuilt database with python....no need to install seperately new software
🛠 Prebuilt: No separate installation or server setup is needed — it comes bundled with Python (sqlite3 module).

🧳 Self-contained: Entire database is stored in a single .db file.

📦 Embedded/Serverless: Doesn’t run as a background service. It’s embedded into the application that uses it.

💡 Zero-config: No config files, users, passwords, or setup commands needed.
This project simulates basic banking operations such as creating an account, logging in with a PIN, checking balance, depositing, and withdrawing money. All data is stored using SQLite, ensuring persistence across sessions.

🛠 Features

Create new bank accounts

Secure login using account number and PIN

Deposit and withdraw funds

Check account balance

SQLite database backend (bank.db)

run the project
```bash
python python-project/bank-atm-sql-project/main.py
```
